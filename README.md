Nate's Dotfiles
---------------

A simple rake task which downloads all my dotfiles, installs any dependencies, and symlinks them approriately. This will in the future be integrated with a script which installs any apps and binaries I use, to completely provision a new personal dev machine.

Installation
------------

```
$ cd /path/to/dotfile/parent
$ git clone https://github.com/codemang/Dotfiles.git
$ rake
```
